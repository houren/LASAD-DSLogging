# LASAD
This is the version of the LASAD Project developed for Java 8 and Tomcat 8, but it can also be run on Java 7 and Tomcat 7 with a simple modification of the buildfile (see user-manual-LASAD for detailed instructions on everything LASAD).  LASAD is a tool for teaching collaborative argument construction via interactive diagrams.  It has been updated from the demo available at http://lasad-demo.cses.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lasad/ by Kevin Loughlin, intern for Dr. Bruce McLaren of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.  The official research website for LASAD can be found at http://cses.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/details/lasad/ .
